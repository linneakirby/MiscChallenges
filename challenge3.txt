Solution for Cipher Tech Solutions Challenge 3

The image was taken at:
	RFK Stadium
	2400 E Capitol St SE
	Washington, DC
	20003

The altitude was 39.40 m above sea level and the time was 01:12:03.

There were various other fields contained within the metadata, including an Exif IFD, which I could have parsed, but that would have taken more time and I thought it would be better to get back to you sooner rather than later.

The other fields were:
	EquipMake
	EquipModel
	Orientation
	XResolution
	YResolution
	ResolutionUnit
	DateTime
	YCbCrPositioning

And in the Exif IFD:
	ExifExposureTime
	ExifNumber
	ExifExposureProg
	ExifISOSpeed
	ExifVer
	ExifDTOrig
	ExifDTDigitized
	ExifCompConfig
	ExifCompBPP
	ExifShutterSpeed
	ExifBrightness
	ExifExposureBias
	ExifMaxAperture
	ExifMeteringMode
	ExifLightSource
	ExifFlash
	ExifFocalLength
	ExifMakerNote
	ExifDTOrigSS
	ExifFPXVer
	ExifColorSpace
	ExifPixXDim
	ExifPixYDim
	ExifInterop
